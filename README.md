# ThatLine ðŸŽ¬

Ever remember a line from a movie but can't place it? Stop endlessly searching. **ThatLine** is a simple, AI-powered tool that finds the exact dialogue you're looking for from any subtitle file.



## About The Project

As a movie buff, I often found myself with a line stuck in my head, unable to remember the film. Traditional keyword searches often fail if you don't remember the exact wording.

ThatLine solves this by using **semantic search**. Instead of just matching keywords, our AI understands the *meaning* and *context* behind your query. This means you can search for "car chase scene" and find lines about "driving fast," even if the word "car" isn't there.

Just upload a standard `.srt` subtitle file, type what you remember, and get instant results with timestamps.
