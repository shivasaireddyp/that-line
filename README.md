# That Line

Ever remember a line from a movie but can't place it? Stop endlessly searching. **That Line** is a simple, AI-powered tool that finds the exact dialogue you're looking for from any subtitle file.



## About The Project

* **Find any scene, instantly.** Ever know the movie and remember a specific line, but can't find the exact moment? ThatLine solves the frustrating experience of scrubbing through a film to find one specific clip.

* **AI-Powered Semantic Search.** Go beyond simple keyword matching. Powered by AI, the app understands the *meaning* and *context* behind your query. This means you can find a scene even if you only remember the gist of the dialogue, not the exact words.

* **Perfect for Creators and Fans.** It's an essential tool for **video editors** trying to quickly locate clips and a fun utility for **movie fans** wanting to relive a favorite moment or settle a debate.
